    "description": "Ah, yes my first project at UMass.\n\nStocksmith was born from my nascent interests in stocks and ML and their intersecting potential. What started as a web platform evolved to take its final form as a library.\n\nStocksmith provides packages for techincal, fundamental and sentimental analysis using ML and NLP. This was a collaborative effort between ACM ML and Google DSC at UMass."
