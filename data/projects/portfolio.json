    "description": "This website is a third iteration and is made using Next.js, a production grade React framework with a lot of benefits such as prerendering and prefetching.\n\nAll data is dynamically pulled from JSON files at compile time, making this super fast.\n\nI've used Framer-Motion for most animations which integrates very well with Next.js."
