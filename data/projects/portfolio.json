    "description": "This website is a third iteration and is made using Next.js. Next.js is a production grade React framework with a lot of benefits such as prerendering, prefetching and auto-routing.\n\nAll data is dynamically pulled from JSON files at compile time so that rendering this website becomes smooth and fast.\n\nI've used Framer-Motion for most animations which integrates every well with Next.js.\n\nHope this isn't much of an eyesore."
