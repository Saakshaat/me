This was a product of COVID ðŸ¦ !\n\nI built the pilot with the FERN stack with my team and with great feedback from our beta-testers, we started building the final version.\n\nThe current version is built in Rails in collab with DSC UMass, UIUC and NTU and supports Slack-like versioning for each org."
